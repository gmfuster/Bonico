                    This page is just a PDF with some cards with rhyming words.  Print it, laminate it if possible, cut the cards, and play.
                    <br/>
                    To play, give a few cards to each player and have them ask the others for something that rhymes with their card.  Or have some of the cards
                    up and take turns taking a card from a stack, see how many cards they can rhyme.  Or do your own thing :-)
